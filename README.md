# small-indie-game-project
A small game I'm working on. I am using unity and blender for this project and leaning/using C# for the code, with microsoft visual studio. The project is a racing game that takes inspiration from games like Mario kart ,F-zero and sonic riders. The game will be about racing agaisnt others and there will be some racers and hoverboards to choose from that will have their own statistics and abilites. Im aiming for it to have singleplayer or local multiplayer gameplay before thinking about multiplayer.

These are some pictures of my textured hover board models.
